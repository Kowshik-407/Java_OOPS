Data Types in Java  

    -> Primitive Data Types
    -> Reference Variables

        // Identifiers in JAVA

        /** 
         * Variables --> Which can vary or hold any value
         * Datatype  --> To define the type of variables
         * Literals  --> These are the constant Value which cannot be changed
         * 
         * Rules for Variables :-
         * --> It cannot start with number, but it contain number
         * --> Should contains character and in special char it allows '_' or '$'  
         * 
         * Datatypes :-
         * -->  'byte'       size of byte  is 1 byte
         * -->  'short'      size of short is 2 byte
         * -->  'int'        size of int is 4 byte
         * -->  'long'       size of long is 8 byte
         * -->  'float'      size of float is 4 byte
         * -->  'double'     size of double is 8 byte
         *
         * Datatype Boolean can hold true or false
         *
         * Datatypes 'byte','short','int','long' will hold numbers
         * Datatypes 'float','double' will hold decimals
         * 
         * Valid Variable Names
         * a1
         * $a
         * _______________________a
         * a222222222222222222222222
         * 
         * Invalid Variable Names
         * @a
         * +a
         * 2a
         * #aaaa

Literals in Java

    -> Integer Literals
    -> Decimal Literals
    -> Octal Literals
    -> Hexadecimal Literals
    -> Floating point Literals
    -> Boolean Literals
    -> Character Literals
    -> String Literals

Data Type Conversions

    -> Implicit Conversions (Non lossy)
    -> Explicit Conversions (can be lossy)

Operators In Java

    -> Assignment Operators
    -> Arithmetic Operators
    -> Relational Operators
    -> Conditional Operators
    -> Logical Operators
    -> instanceof Comparison

Assignment Operators

    a = a + b can be written as a += b
    a = a - b can be written as a -= b
    a = a * b can be written as a *= b
    a = a / b can be written as a /= b
    a = a % b can be written as a %= b

Arithmetic Operators
    Addition                +
    Subtraction             -
    Multiplication          *
    Division                /
    Remainder Operator      %
    String Concatenation    '+'

Increment And Decrement Operators
    Prefix
    Postfix
    Multiplication
    Division
    Remainder Operator 
    String Concatenation

Relational Operators
    > 
    >=
    <
    <= 
    ==
    !=
    

Conditional Operators
    Terenary Operator
    Boolean Expression ? Value if true : value if false

Difference Betwewen Static and Non-static

static         --> class
    -> directly access 
non-static     --> object
    -> access through objects

static cannot referred to non-static without creating objects
